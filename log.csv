2025-07-21T11:34:39.753576,"Race to 2027: PDP’s flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit
•Zoning, consensus strategy top Thursday’s PDP’s NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party’s 2027 presidential ticket underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has cleared the way for Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, and other hopefuls seeking to challenge President Bola Tinubu, The PUNCH reports.Reliable PDP insiders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the presidential ambitions of Makinde and Bala were well known among key party stakeholders.Another party source revealed that the PDP remained open to any aspirant willing to contest for the presidential ticket in line with the party’s constitution.While PDP chieftain Chief Bode George confirmed in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH that efforts to secure a southern presidential flagbearer are underway, other National Executive Committee members have expressed differing opinions on the issue of zoning.As the PDP prepares for its 101st NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday July 24, The PUNCH exclusively gathered that critical issues — such as zoning and the party’s national convention — are high on the agenda for discussion and resolution.Reacting in an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the All Progressives Congress Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, stated that no matter the PDP’s zoning decision or choice of candidate, the party was destined for defeat in 2027.Recently, during its 100th NEC meeting held on June 30, the PDP resolved the long-standing dispute over the position of National Secretary by confirming Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the party’s scribe.However, despite this resolution, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and some of his loyalists left the party, citing unresolved internal conflicts. Atiku, along with other opposition figures, has continued to criticise the ruling APC for its poor governance performance.In response, on July 1, Atiku, 2023 Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi; former APC presidential aspirant, Rotimi Amaechi; former Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai, and others united under the African Democratic Congress, positioning it as a joint opposition platform to challenge the APC in the 2027 elections.As part of this coalition effort, they appointed former Senate President David Mark as interim National Chairman and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola as interim National Secretary.Explaining his departure from the PDP, Atiku, who was the party’s presidential flagbearer in 2019 and 2023, said the party’s current trajectory no longer reflected its founding values, prompting his decision to step away.Atiku’s letter read in part, “I am writing to formally resign my membership from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) with immediate effect.“I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude for the opportunities I have been given by the Party. Serving two full terms as Vice President of Nigeria and being a Presidential candidate twice has been one of the most significant chapters of my life. As a founding father of this esteemed Party, it is indeed heartbreaking for me to make this decision.“However, I find it necessary to part ways due to the current trajectory the Party has taken, which I believe diverges from the foundational principles we stood for. It is with a heavy heart that I resign, recognizing the irreconcilable differences that have emerged.”A party insider told The PUNCH that Atiku’s 2027 presidential ambition has posed a challenge both to the party’s stability and to the aspirations of other contenders.The source stated, “You see, the exit of Atiku Abubakar is going to bring calm to the party. You know, before now, his ambition has always been a threat to the ambition of others, even to the peace in the party.“Party leaders are always skeptical about how they resolve one or two issues so that they won’t play into his hands or into his favour. But now that he has left the party, I think it’s going to clear the path for others to pursue their ambition.“I know that the likes of Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and other leaders of our party are aspiring to run on the party’s ticket for the 2027 election. But of course, popular among leaders of the party and other stakeholders within the party for now are Makinde and Bala Mohammed.“We know that others will still come and aspire for the party’s ticket come 2027. As a matter of fact, the doors of the party are open to those who are willing to aspire for the ticket.“PDP is a party for all Nigerians. It is a popular party with structure across all the local governments, the wards, and the states, a very formidable opposition. Forget the noise that the ADC is making. PDP still remains the major opposition party. We have governors. We have senators. We have elected assembly members and quite a lot more to offer Nigerians.”Another source stated that Atiku’s presidential ambition has consistently caused turmoil within the PDP, adding that his departure would create room for fresh and capable individuals to pursue their aspirations.He stated, “I listened to many Nigerians talking about Atiku’s exit. They focus on just looking at the whole PDP as finished, the whole PDP as that. But the other positive side to it: would Atiku’s ambition, or has Atiku’s ambition been a source of problem for the PDP in the last, let’s say, eight years?“Of course, the ambition had caused crisis for in party. Recall in 2019, it was a tug-of-war within the party. And in 2023, you know, the five governors and quite a lot of others still did not support Atiku’s ambition and presidential ambition. Even though he emerged as a candidate, most of them still did not work for him. In fact, that was when Peter Obi also left the party.“So, a man who, to a large extent, his ambition has always caused disaffection within the party, then decides to leave the party. So, it’s also a thing of joy for some of us that are members of the party now that he has left to pursue his ambition elsewhere. Then the party can sit up, sit together and resolve some of their issues. And then this will allow a new crop of leaders to emerge, new set of credible and competent leaders that we have in our party to declare their own interests and aspire for the party’s ticket.”Our source named Makinde and Bala Mohammed as potential aspirants, saying more Nigerians will follow.He source stated, “Well, you are asking me who and who are interested in the party ticket so far. Well, even though they have not come out publicly to declare their interest, we have been hearing among us, the leaders of the party, that the likes of Makinde and then Bala Mohammed and even some former governors from the South are interested in aspiring for the party’s ticket for the 2027 presidential election.“But it is, of course, too early, because we know with time more people will declare, and then more will still join the party and aspire for the party ticket. So the PDP is open to all, and it is the party that is very popular among Nigerians.”Attempts by our correspondent to reach PDP Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, were unsuccessful as he did not answer calls.Attempts to reach Governor Bala’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mukhtar Gidado, through calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages were unsuccessful.Meanwhile, The PUNCH noticed that a youth group known as the Bala Mohammed Vanguard has been actively mobilising support for Governor Bala’s presidential ambition.The group, led by its Director-General Mohammed Jibo — who also serves as Chairman of Dass Local Government Area and a close political associate of the governor — has been at the forefront of the campaign.Speaking on the matter, the group’s Director of Media and Publicity, Mudaddasir Musa, confirmed that Governor Bala would throw his hat in the ring in the 2027 general election.Related NewsADC: The new bride with two husbandsThose pushing for VP slot for Obi only want to ruin him – LP chieftainReform-induced agony persistsHe stated, “Governor Bala Mohammed will aspire for the Presidency. And we are strongly behind him, following his track records as public servant, FCT minister.“Till this time, no one has matched his steps as FCT minister, likewise in Bauchi, there has never been a governor that built capital projects like him. Bala Mohammed is the only individual we believe can save Nigeria from its present security and economic crisis.”While a credible NEC source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the issue, supported throwing open the 2027 PDP’s presidential ticket to all Nigerians, others like George and Deputy National Youth Leader Timothy Osadolor are pushing for a southern candidate.However, former PDP National Vice Chairman (South West), Eddy Olafeso, stated that party leaders were committed to learning from past mistakes, while former National Secretary, Ibrahim Tsauri, advised members to allow the party’s organs to make decisions and cautioned against preempting the NEC and zoning committee’s outcomes.The source argued that opening the contest would allow credible, popular, and competent candidates to emerge.He stated, “Zoning is not a constitutional matter. There is no section of our constitution that says the Presidency must be zoned to any geopolitical zone. So I think, for me, considering how the party has been managed for a while and the last couple of elections, the party should throw its ticket open for 2027.“This will give room to credible people. We’ll have more people who are competent coming to aspire for the ticket. And consequently, competent and capable candidates will emerge that will likely give us the victory that we’ve been yearning for.“The ticket should be open to all Nigerians. This is not the time to say it’s South or North, no. Let’s leave it open. Let the most popular win. Let the most competent emerge.”This is just as the former Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, George, hinted that the search for such a person has begun.George told The PUNCH, “That process of getting a southerner as presidential flagbearer of the party is on. In politics, there is no shut down. We are going for a meeting this week, a make or break meeting if you like.“Arrangements are going on already and there are quite some respectable, responsible people with good character, tested and proven but it is too early to start throwing names up. If you do that now, you are looking for trouble,” he said.In an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, Osadolor warned against narrowing the 2027 presidential race to Atiku, Obi, and President Tinubu.He called for the PDP’s 2027 presidential ticket to be zoned to the South.Osadolor stated, “Well, the truth is this. Limiting a country of over 240 million people to just names on a list of less than 10, which the Waziri of Adamawa (Atiku) happens to be one of, I think it’s a disservice to over 240 million Nigerians and over 10 million Nigerians that are eligible to be President of this nation.“You see, there is nobody that was created or given birth to, and the staff of office of President was presented to or handed over to from the Israelis. Many Nigerians that are constitutionally qualified have rights to contest.“The truth is this: narrowing down the PDP ticket or any ticket to only Atiku, Obi or Tinubu is a disservice to the rest of all Nigerians. I believe that there are other people in the country and within the PDP who also have track records of service delivery to Nigerian people.”However, Osadolor suggested that the PDP is still waiting for former President Goodluck Jonathan to make a decision on whether he will contest or not.He stated, “We have people like Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom, who transformed the landscape of Akwa Ibom into something else. We have the governor of Oyo, Seyi Makinde, who is doing incredibly well and has turned the landscape of Oyo from an ancient sleeping kingdom into a modern, fast-growing industrial state.“So, there are people. There are people everywhere. So, as the days go by — and you are also aware — Goodluck Jonathan is there too. So, there are other people like him within the party, it’s a matter of decision-making for them to convince themselves that they want to throw their hat in the ring.“Therefore, I can assure you, PDP is not going to run out of options. Not today, not anytime soon. And I also know that the PDP ticket is going to the South.“The indices are there. The party — the last time, I it was thrown open. And I think the voices is audible enough and it is clearer to most of us, that it is going to South this time around.”Olafeso remarked that just as the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not mark the end of Japan, the departure of Atiku and others will not spell the end of the PDP.The former PDP National Vice Chairman expressed confidence that the party will emerge stronger from the situation.He added, “Our desire at this moment is to stabilise our party and begin to ensure that the mistakes we made in the past will be a milestone through which we guide our actions in the future.”On the zoning of the PDP 2027 presidential ticket, Olafeso said, “We’re all committed to the fact that we have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that we stick to the constitution of our party, and that everything we do must be driven by fairness, equity, and justice.”Speaking exclusively with one of our correspondents, Tsauri stated that the PDP was already widely accepted by Nigerians and will make anyone who emerges as its 2027 presidential candidate popular.He stated, “Our party is popular. PDP is still the most popular party in Nigeria. Any individual who emerges as the party’s candidate, the party will make the person popular, because it is the most popular party in Nigeria today.“For the zoning of the 2027 presidential ticket, I will appeal that we all wait for the NEC and the zoning committee to decide. We should not preempt the organs of the party.”Meanwhile, a credible high-ranking PDP member, who spoke to The PUNCH on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorisation, revealed that the 101st NEC meeting would discuss whether the convention will still hold as scheduled in August.He stated, “As you are aware, the 101st NEC meeting is slated for Thursday, July 24. Plans are underway for the meeting to hold as scheduled.“And the major issue to be discussed is the National Elective Convention. The NEC will take reports from the committees, including the zoning committee. It will review how feasible it is to hold the convention in August as scheduled. So, zoning and the convention will be deliberated.”In response, the APC Director of Publicity Bala Ibrahim said President Tinubu would defeat Makinde, Bala Mohammed, or any other candidate the PDP presents in the election.Ibrahim stated, “These are people (Makinde and Bala Mohammed) that are not of any relevance at the national level. These are regional players that cannot stand the test of national politics. They don’t have the competitive advantage over our own candidate.“So the people you mentioned — they are not people that can beat him under any level playing field. It’s not an issue that will give us any bitter pain. Regardless of which zone the PDP goes to or the candidate they settle for, defeat awaits them all.”","Race to 2027: PDP’s flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit. •Zoning, consensus strategy top Thursday’s PDP NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party presidential ticket of 2027 underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has ",
2025-07-21T11:34:46.192979,"Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari
Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, The PUNCH reports. This translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the review period.This is according to a detailed analysis of data from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s quarterly statistical bulletins. The sum, recorded under the “Health-Related and Social Services” category, reflects cumulative outflows of foreign exchange from June 2015 to May 2023 — precisely covering the duration of Buhari’s two-term presidency, which spanned from May 29, 2015, to May 28, 2023.The data, reviewed by our correspondent, shows the depth of Nigeria’s dependence on foreign healthcare services, with the CBN’s record showing a year-on-year movement of funds abroad for medical purposes amid economic downturns or dollar shortages at home.It also highlights the irony that, despite repeated declarations by the administration to revamp the health sector and reduce capital flight, health-related foreign exchange outflows remained significant and even spiked dramatically during the latter years of Buhari’s presidency.A close review of the spending pattern shows that the first year of Buhari’s presidency recorded the single highest amount spent on medical tourism. Between June 2015 and May 2016, Nigeria spent $7.81bn on health-related services abroad.This figure alone accounted for over a quarter of the total medical tourism expenditure under his administration. Notably, September 2015 stood out as a month of exceptional outflow, with $3.20bn disbursed — the highest for any single month throughout the eight-year period.That spike occurred during Buhari’s first few months in office and was followed by elevated monthly figures in October, November, and December of 2015, which further raised questions about whether the expenditure reflected a backlog of deferred medical bills or a broader trend among elites seeking healthcare abroad immediately after the administration took office.In the subsequent year, between June 2016 and May 2017, the figure dipped to $2.76bn, although substantial sums were still recorded in months such as March 2016 ($0.96bn) and April 2016 ($0.67bn).Spending continued to decline in Buhari’s third year in office, falling to $1.72bn between June 2017 and May 2018. By the fourth year of the first term, which ran from June 2018 to May 2019, Nigeria’s medical tourism bill had dropped sharply to just $0.44bn — the lowest across all eight years.However, a closer examination of the second term reveals a different picture. After a relatively low fifth year, when Nigeria spent $0.92bn on medical services abroad between June 2019 and May 2020, there was a slight increase in the sixth year, with foreign exchange outflows reaching $1.57bn.This modest recovery coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed global travel restrictions and temporarily subdued international medical travel. The data during the lockdown period between April 2020 and June 2021 reflected lower figures, but it also hinted at pent-up demand that would soon be unleashed.Indeed, from June 2021, medical tourism experienced a surge once again. The seventh year of Buhari’s administration — between June 2021 and May 2022 — recorded $6.96bn in health-related foreign exchange disbursements.June 2021 alone accounted for $3.02bn, almost matching the record set back in 2015. April 2022 saw another massive jump with $1.28bn spent, suggesting that Nigerians, particularly the affluent class and public officials, resumed international travel en masse to seek healthcare that remained inaccessible or underdeveloped at home.The eighth and final year of the administration recorded the second-highest annual expenditure, with $7.12bn spent between June 2022 and May 2023. January 2023 was a particularly costly month, accounting for $2.30bn in medical outflows — the third highest monthly figure during Buhari’s presidency.With this late surge in medical tourism spending, the second term of Buhari’s government, which initially appeared more conservative in terms of health-related foreign exchange usage, ended up outpacing the first term.Related NewsPresidential aide slams Kemi Badenoch over Nigerian citizenship claimBuhari never used vote-buying to win elections – OkechukwuKano commission demotes court registrar, clerical assistant for forgery, falsificationA total of $16.56bn was spent in the second term, compared to $12.73bn in the first term. This shift suggests that, despite earlier constraints, the underlying drivers of medical tourism — including poor local healthcare infrastructure, lack of trust in domestic medical services, and the elite’s preference for foreign treatment — remained unaddressed and may have worsened.Throughout his presidency, Buhari was frequently criticised for seeking medical care abroad. He made multiple trips to the United Kingdom for undisclosed treatments, sometimes staying for extended periods.Buhari, during his eight-year reign, spent at least 225 days outside the country on medical trips, visiting no fewer than 40 countries since 2015. Eight months after assuming office, the former President embarked on his first medical trip to London, United Kingdom, on February 5, 2016, spending six days.His second medical trip followed four months later, on June 6, 2016, during which he spent 10 days treating an undisclosed ear infection. On January 19, 2017, Buhari embarked on his second-longest medical trip to London, spending 50 days away.In May of the same year, barely two months after his last trip, he returned to London for what became his longest medical stay, lasting 104 days. He did not return to the UK for medical purposes again until May 2018, when he spent four days on a follow-up review.In March 2021, Buhari departed for London once again, on what the Presidency described as a “routine medical check-up,” which lasted 15 days. His departure came amid a labour crisis in the health sector, during which members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors commenced an indefinite strike over unpaid allowances.Almost a year later, on March 6, 2022, the ex-President travelled to London again for medical reasons. This time, he spent 12 days. On October 31, 2022, Buhari departed from Owerri, the capital of Imo State, to London for another medical check-up, which lasted approximately two weeks. He returned to the country on November 13, 2022.Former presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, consistently defended Buhari’s foreign medical trips, stating that he “has used the same medical team for about 40 years.” In a recent interview following Buhari’s death, Adesina argued: “If he had said I’d do my medicals in Nigeria just for show off or something, he could have long been dead.”In total, Buhari undertook 84 trips to 40 countries during his tenure in office.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Medical and Dental Consultants’ Association of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors earlier criticised political leaders for consistently seeking medical care abroad while neglecting the country’s healthcare system.The President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, Dr Tope Osundara, described the trend as not only disheartening but an indictment of Nigerian leaders’ investments in the sector they are expected to strengthen.Osundara expressed disappointment that Nigerian leaders continue to patronise foreign hospitals despite annual budget allocations to domestic medical facilities like the State House Clinic.“It’s more like building a company, investing resources in it, then refusing to use the product and telling others to trust it. It tells you that something is fundamentally wrong with the system, with the people entrusted with managing it.“There was a time when the former president, Muhammad Buhari, made some utterances that they should abolish this medical tourism. But unfortunately, before he died, he was even at the forefront of going abroad for treatment. Even a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, disclosed that he and Buhari were admitted to the same hospital in London shortly before Buhari passed away. This tells you that Nigeria’s healthcare system is in bad shape.”On his part, the President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof Bala Audu, noted that while individuals are free to seek care wherever they choose, the consistent reliance of public office holders on foreign hospitals despite Nigeria’s budgetary allocations to domestic healthcare speaks volumes about misplaced priorities.","Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari , translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the re",
2025-07-21T11:34:54.331195,"Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash
Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo, has defended his remarks on Labour Party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Peter Obi, amid mounting backlash from human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), the African Democratic Congress and the Obidient Movement.The governor had stirred controversy after warning that Obi must obtain security clearance before visiting Edo State, a statement critics described as a direct threat to Obi’s life and a dangerous precedent for democracy.While Falana urged Obi to take legal action over what he termed an “illegal threat,” ADC and Obidient Movement leader, Dr Yunusa Tanko, accused Okpebholo of intimidation and spreading falsehoods.The Edo State government, however, insisted that the governor’s comments at a rally on Friday were misinterpreted, stressing that his call was a security protocol and not hostility toward the opposition leader.The governor slammed the critics, adding that the statement should not be misconstrued as a threat.In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Fred Itua, the government said that Okpebholo’s statement was given various misinterpretations.“The attention of the Edo State Government has been drawn to various misinterpretations surrounding the recent remarks made by Governor of Edo State, Senator Monday Okpebholo, regarding the visit of Peter Obi to the state.“It is imperative to state clearly that the governor did not issue any form of threat to Mr Obi, but rather emphasised the need for high-profile individuals, particularly politically exposed persons, to notify and seek security clearance from the governor before embarking on any public engagements within the state.“As the Chief Security Officer of Edo State, it is the governor’s constitutional responsibility to safeguard the lives and property of all residents and visitors alike.“This duty includes ensuring that adequate security measures are put in place during high-profile visits or events that may attract large crowds or media attention.“When such protocols are ignored, it creates serious security vulnerabilities, not only for the visitor but also for citizens who may be caught in avoidable threats,” the statement read.Itua said the governor’s position was relevant in light of the rising attacks and abductions of religious leaders, especially Catholic priests and Christian clerics.He noted that the state had witnessed its share of tragic incidents, including the abduction of seminarians and the killing of clergy in recent years.He noted that public donations made to churches, hospitals, or other faith-based institutions, while noble in intent, must be approached with caution and in full consultation with the appropriate security channels to avoid exposing these institutions and their leaders to further danger.He added, “The governor’s comments on the need for discretion in public giving are rooted in both security intelligence and moral responsibility…“Governor Okpebholo is not Peter Obi, who, as Governor of Anambra State, detained Nasir El-Rufai when he visited.“Furthermore, the governor’s concerns should not be twisted for political mileage by individuals seeking to score cheap points.“The state government will not fold its arms and allow politically motivated activities to endanger lives.“We expect leaders, no matter how highly placed, to align with the protocols and security realities of the areas they visit.”Earlier on Sunday, Falana had asked Okpebholo to withdraw the threats to the life of Obi.In a statement, the senior lawyer noted that the threat to the life of Obi issued by the “new sheriff in town” in Edo State constituted a violation of Section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples (Ratification and Enforcement), which guarantee the fundamental right of every citizen to life.“However, if Governor Okpebholo does not withdraw the illegal threat because of sheer arrogance of raw power, Mr Peter Obi should proceed to file an application in the Benin Judicial Division of the Federal High Court to secure the enforcement of his fundamental right to life.“Mr Obi should act with utmost urgency in view of the prevalence of mob justice and other forms of extrajudicial killings in the country,” the statement added.Related NewsADC: The new bride with two husbandsThose pushing for VP slot for Obi only want to ruin him – LP chieftainTaraba gov reaffirms PDP loyalty, dismisses ADC defection rumourThe ADC’s interim National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, speaking with journalists, warned that such threats were becoming a troubling trend among APC governors.He stressed that the party was informing both Nigerians and the international community about the situation, against the right to move freely across all states by every Nigerian.“The African Democratic Congress condemns the restriction order issued on Peter Obi.“This is not the first time. It is becoming a pattern for APC governors to make the kind of pronouncements credited to Governor Okpebholo, declaring that Mr Obi or opposition leaders are not welcome in their state.“This is not democratic, and it’s a very dangerous pattern. Nigeria is a free country, and every citizen of Nigeria has the right to go anywhere in this country.“We don’t need a visa in our country. We don’t need anybody’s permission to go to any part of our country.“This also speaks to an authoritarian instinct among some of these governors of the APC, and we believe that this can only get worse if it’s not nipped in the bud,” he added.Abdullahi said, having failed to turn Nigeria into a one-party state, the strategy is to begin to intimidate and issue threats and warnings not to come to their states.“This is unacceptable. We will go anywhere in Nigeria that we want because Nigeria is a free country,” he said.Tanko, in his reaction, debunked claims by Okpebholo that Obi was responsible for the 2013 detention of former Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai.Tanko, who also served as the campaign spokesman for Obi during the 2023 presidential election, described the allegation as “a complete falsehood.”Speaking in a phone interview with our correspondent, Tanko insisted that Okpebholo was either misinformed or deliberately peddling lies.“It is obvious Governor Okpebholo festers on lies and doesn’t even know what he is talking about.“Even Nasir can never come out to say that again after I debunked it. I have proof that there is no iota of truth in that allegation,” he said.He explained that at the time of the incident, he was the national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council and was physically present in Anambra State during the election where the controversy occurred.“I was the then-national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council during that election. Peter Obi was also then an APGA governor in Anambra, and the PDP was at the centre.“At that time, El-Rufai was the assistant secretary of the ACN. He has the fundamental right to go into the state and support his agent. But they thought he came with blood money to mobilise people and induce voters, so they denied him.“So it was the PDP, not Obi. Obi himself said it on the floor that he was seeking succour too for himself, not to block anybody,” he said.Tanko said he still possessed photographic evidence to support his claims and reminded the public that El-Rufai himself had brought the complaint directly to him during the election.“In fact, I can show you pictures of where I was seated as IPAC chairman when Nasir himself brought the complaint to me.“I still have them, and I remember also hosting a press conference on this particular issue at the campaign venue of Peter Obi,” he said.Tanko also dismissed Okpebholo’s political experience, calling him a “greenhorn.”“It is obvious Okpebholo is just a greenhorn in this game of politics. The governor doesn’t know anything. He is just shooting blanks.”","Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash.

2025-07-21T11:39:16.944508,"Race to 2027: PDP’s flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit
•Zoning, consensus strategy top Thursday’s PDP’s NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party’s 2027 presidential ticket underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has cleared the way for Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, and other hopefuls seeking to challenge President Bola Tinubu, The PUNCH reports.Reliable PDP insiders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the presidential ambitions of Makinde and Bala were well known among key party stakeholders.Another party source revealed that the PDP remained open to any aspirant willing to contest for the presidential ticket in line with the party’s constitution.While PDP chieftain Chief Bode George confirmed in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH that efforts to secure a southern presidential flagbearer are underway, other National Executive Committee members have expressed differing opinions on the issue of zoning.As the PDP prepares for its 101st NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday July 24, The PUNCH exclusively gathered that critical issues — such as zoning and the party’s national convention — are high on the agenda for discussion and resolution.Reacting in an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the All Progressives Congress Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, stated that no matter the PDP’s zoning decision or choice of candidate, the party was destined for defeat in 2027.Recently, during its 100th NEC meeting held on June 30, the PDP resolved the long-standing dispute over the position of National Secretary by confirming Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the party’s scribe.However, despite this resolution, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and some of his loyalists left the party, citing unresolved internal conflicts. Atiku, along with other opposition figures, has continued to criticise the ruling APC for its poor governance performance.In response, on July 1, Atiku, 2023 Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi; former APC presidential aspirant, Rotimi Amaechi; former Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai, and others united under the African Democratic Congress, positioning it as a joint opposition platform to challenge the APC in the 2027 elections.As part of this coalition effort, they appointed former Senate President David Mark as interim National Chairman and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola as interim National Secretary.Explaining his departure from the PDP, Atiku, who was the party’s presidential flagbearer in 2019 and 2023, said the party’s current trajectory no longer reflected its founding values, prompting his decision to step away.Atiku’s letter read in part, “I am writing to formally resign my membership from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) with immediate effect.“I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude for the opportunities I have been given by the Party. Serving two full terms as Vice President of Nigeria and being a Presidential candidate twice has been one of the most significant chapters of my life. As a founding father of this esteemed Party, it is indeed heartbreaking for me to make this decision.“However, I find it necessary to part ways due to the current trajectory the Party has taken, which I believe diverges from the foundational principles we stood for. It is with a heavy heart that I resign, recognizing the irreconcilable differences that have emerged.”A party insider told The PUNCH that Atiku’s 2027 presidential ambition has posed a challenge both to the party’s stability and to the aspirations of other contenders.The source stated, “You see, the exit of Atiku Abubakar is going to bring calm to the party. You know, before now, his ambition has always been a threat to the ambition of others, even to the peace in the party.“Party leaders are always skeptical about how they resolve one or two issues so that they won’t play into his hands or into his favour. But now that he has left the party, I think it’s going to clear the path for others to pursue their ambition.“I know that the likes of Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and other leaders of our party are aspiring to run on the party’s ticket for the 2027 election. But of course, popular among leaders of the party and other stakeholders within the party for now are Makinde and Bala Mohammed.“We know that others will still come and aspire for the party’s ticket come 2027. As a matter of fact, the doors of the party are open to those who are willing to aspire for the ticket.“PDP is a party for all Nigerians. It is a popular party with structure across all the local governments, the wards, and the states, a very formidable opposition. Forget the noise that the ADC is making. PDP still remains the major opposition party. We have governors. We have senators. We have elected assembly members and quite a lot more to offer Nigerians.”Another source stated that Atiku’s presidential ambition has consistently caused turmoil within the PDP, adding that his departure would create room for fresh and capable individuals to pursue their aspirations.He stated, “I listened to many Nigerians talking about Atiku’s exit. They focus on just looking at the whole PDP as finished, the whole PDP as that. But the other positive side to it: would Atiku’s ambition, or has Atiku’s ambition been a source of problem for the PDP in the last, let’s say, eight years?“Of course, the ambition had caused crisis for in party. Recall in 2019, it was a tug-of-war within the party. And in 2023, you know, the five governors and quite a lot of others still did not support Atiku’s ambition and presidential ambition. Even though he emerged as a candidate, most of them still did not work for him. In fact, that was when Peter Obi also left the party.“So, a man who, to a large extent, his ambition has always caused disaffection within the party, then decides to leave the party. So, it’s also a thing of joy for some of us that are members of the party now that he has left to pursue his ambition elsewhere. Then the party can sit up, sit together and resolve some of their issues. And then this will allow a new crop of leaders to emerge, new set of credible and competent leaders that we have in our party to declare their own interests and aspire for the party’s ticket.”Our source named Makinde and Bala Mohammed as potential aspirants, saying more Nigerians will follow.He source stated, “Well, you are asking me who and who are interested in the party ticket so far. Well, even though they have not come out publicly to declare their interest, we have been hearing among us, the leaders of the party, that the likes of Makinde and then Bala Mohammed and even some former governors from the South are interested in aspiring for the party’s ticket for the 2027 presidential election.“But it is, of course, too early, because we know with time more people will declare, and then more will still join the party and aspire for the party ticket. So the PDP is open to all, and it is the party that is very popular among Nigerians.”Attempts by our correspondent to reach PDP Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, were unsuccessful as he did not answer calls.Attempts to reach Governor Bala’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mukhtar Gidado, through calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages were unsuccessful.Meanwhile, The PUNCH noticed that a youth group known as the Bala Mohammed Vanguard has been actively mobilising support for Governor Bala’s presidential ambition.The group, led by its Director-General Mohammed Jibo — who also serves as Chairman of Dass Local Government Area and a close political associate of the governor — has been at the forefront of the campaign.Speaking on the matter, the group’s Director of Media and Publicity, Mudaddasir Musa, confirmed that Governor Bala would throw his hat in the ring in the 2027 general election.Related NewsADC: The new bride with two husbandsThose pushing for VP slot for Obi only want to ruin him – LP chieftainReform-induced agony persistsHe stated, “Governor Bala Mohammed will aspire for the Presidency. And we are strongly behind him, following his track records as public servant, FCT minister.“Till this time, no one has matched his steps as FCT minister, likewise in Bauchi, there has never been a governor that built capital projects like him. Bala Mohammed is the only individual we believe can save Nigeria from its present security and economic crisis.”While a credible NEC source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the issue, supported throwing open the 2027 PDP’s presidential ticket to all Nigerians, others like George and Deputy National Youth Leader Timothy Osadolor are pushing for a southern candidate.However, former PDP National Vice Chairman (South West), Eddy Olafeso, stated that party leaders were committed to learning from past mistakes, while former National Secretary, Ibrahim Tsauri, advised members to allow the party’s organs to make decisions and cautioned against preempting the NEC and zoning committee’s outcomes.The source argued that opening the contest would allow credible, popular, and competent candidates to emerge.He stated, “Zoning is not a constitutional matter. There is no section of our constitution that says the Presidency must be zoned to any geopolitical zone. So I think, for me, considering how the party has been managed for a while and the last couple of elections, the party should throw its ticket open for 2027.“This will give room to credible people. We’ll have more people who are competent coming to aspire for the ticket. And consequently, competent and capable candidates will emerge that will likely give us the victory that we’ve been yearning for.“The ticket should be open to all Nigerians. This is not the time to say it’s South or North, no. Let’s leave it open. Let the most popular win. Let the most competent emerge.”This is just as the former Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, George, hinted that the search for such a person has begun.George told The PUNCH, “That process of getting a southerner as presidential flagbearer of the party is on. In politics, there is no shut down. We are going for a meeting this week, a make or break meeting if you like.“Arrangements are going on already and there are quite some respectable, responsible people with good character, tested and proven but it is too early to start throwing names up. If you do that now, you are looking for trouble,” he said.In an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, Osadolor warned against narrowing the 2027 presidential race to Atiku, Obi, and President Tinubu.He called for the PDP’s 2027 presidential ticket to be zoned to the South.Osadolor stated, “Well, the truth is this. Limiting a country of over 240 million people to just names on a list of less than 10, which the Waziri of Adamawa (Atiku) happens to be one of, I think it’s a disservice to over 240 million Nigerians and over 10 million Nigerians that are eligible to be President of this nation.“You see, there is nobody that was created or given birth to, and the staff of office of President was presented to or handed over to from the Israelis. Many Nigerians that are constitutionally qualified have rights to contest.“The truth is this: narrowing down the PDP ticket or any ticket to only Atiku, Obi or Tinubu is a disservice to the rest of all Nigerians. I believe that there are other people in the country and within the PDP who also have track records of service delivery to Nigerian people.”However, Osadolor suggested that the PDP is still waiting for former President Goodluck Jonathan to make a decision on whether he will contest or not.He stated, “We have people like Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom, who transformed the landscape of Akwa Ibom into something else. We have the governor of Oyo, Seyi Makinde, who is doing incredibly well and has turned the landscape of Oyo from an ancient sleeping kingdom into a modern, fast-growing industrial state.“So, there are people. There are people everywhere. So, as the days go by — and you are also aware — Goodluck Jonathan is there too. So, there are other people like him within the party, it’s a matter of decision-making for them to convince themselves that they want to throw their hat in the ring.“Therefore, I can assure you, PDP is not going to run out of options. Not today, not anytime soon. And I also know that the PDP ticket is going to the South.“The indices are there. The party — the last time, I it was thrown open. And I think the voices is audible enough and it is clearer to most of us, that it is going to South this time around.”Olafeso remarked that just as the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not mark the end of Japan, the departure of Atiku and others will not spell the end of the PDP.The former PDP National Vice Chairman expressed confidence that the party will emerge stronger from the situation.He added, “Our desire at this moment is to stabilise our party and begin to ensure that the mistakes we made in the past will be a milestone through which we guide our actions in the future.”On the zoning of the PDP 2027 presidential ticket, Olafeso said, “We’re all committed to the fact that we have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that we stick to the constitution of our party, and that everything we do must be driven by fairness, equity, and justice.”Speaking exclusively with one of our correspondents, Tsauri stated that the PDP was already widely accepted by Nigerians and will make anyone who emerges as its 2027 presidential candidate popular.He stated, “Our party is popular. PDP is still the most popular party in Nigeria. Any individual who emerges as the party’s candidate, the party will make the person popular, because it is the most popular party in Nigeria today.“For the zoning of the 2027 presidential ticket, I will appeal that we all wait for the NEC and the zoning committee to decide. We should not preempt the organs of the party.”Meanwhile, a credible high-ranking PDP member, who spoke to The PUNCH on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorisation, revealed that the 101st NEC meeting would discuss whether the convention will still hold as scheduled in August.He stated, “As you are aware, the 101st NEC meeting is slated for Thursday, July 24. Plans are underway for the meeting to hold as scheduled.“And the major issue to be discussed is the National Elective Convention. The NEC will take reports from the committees, including the zoning committee. It will review how feasible it is to hold the convention in August as scheduled. So, zoning and the convention will be deliberated.”In response, the APC Director of Publicity Bala Ibrahim said President Tinubu would defeat Makinde, Bala Mohammed, or any other candidate the PDP presents in the election.Ibrahim stated, “These are people (Makinde and Bala Mohammed) that are not of any relevance at the national level. These are regional players that cannot stand the test of national politics. They don’t have the competitive advantage over our own candidate.“So the people you mentioned — they are not people that can beat him under any level playing field. It’s not an issue that will give us any bitter pain. Regardless of which zone the PDP goes to or the candidate they settle for, defeat awaits them all.”","Race to 2027: PDP flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit. •Zoning, consensus strategy tops Thursday’s PDP NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party presidential ticket of 2027 underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has c",
2025-07-21T11:39:25.340226,"Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari
Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, The PUNCH reports. This translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the review period.This is according to a detailed analysis of data from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s quarterly statistical bulletins. The sum, recorded under the “Health-Related and Social Services” category, reflects cumulative outflows of foreign exchange from June 2015 to May 2023 — precisely covering the duration of Buhari’s two-term presidency, which spanned from May 29, 2015, to May 28, 2023.The data, reviewed by our correspondent, shows the depth of Nigeria’s dependence on foreign healthcare services, with the CBN’s record showing a year-on-year movement of funds abroad for medical purposes amid economic downturns or dollar shortages at home.It also highlights the irony that, despite repeated declarations by the administration to revamp the health sector and reduce capital flight, health-related foreign exchange outflows remained significant and even spiked dramatically during the latter years of Buhari’s presidency.A close review of the spending pattern shows that the first year of Buhari’s presidency recorded the single highest amount spent on medical tourism. Between June 2015 and May 2016, Nigeria spent $7.81bn on health-related services abroad.This figure alone accounted for over a quarter of the total medical tourism expenditure under his administration. Notably, September 2015 stood out as a month of exceptional outflow, with $3.20bn disbursed — the highest for any single month throughout the eight-year period.That spike occurred during Buhari’s first few months in office and was followed by elevated monthly figures in October, November, and December of 2015, which further raised questions about whether the expenditure reflected a backlog of deferred medical bills or a broader trend among elites seeking healthcare abroad immediately after the administration took office.In the subsequent year, between June 2016 and May 2017, the figure dipped to $2.76bn, although substantial sums were still recorded in months such as March 2016 ($0.96bn) and April 2016 ($0.67bn).Spending continued to decline in Buhari’s third year in office, falling to $1.72bn between June 2017 and May 2018. By the fourth year of the first term, which ran from June 2018 to May 2019, Nigeria’s medical tourism bill had dropped sharply to just $0.44bn — the lowest across all eight years.However, a closer examination of the second term reveals a different picture. After a relatively low fifth year, when Nigeria spent $0.92bn on medical services abroad between June 2019 and May 2020, there was a slight increase in the sixth year, with foreign exchange outflows reaching $1.57bn.This modest recovery coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed global travel restrictions and temporarily subdued international medical travel. The data during the lockdown period between April 2020 and June 2021 reflected lower figures, but it also hinted at pent-up demand that would soon be unleashed.Indeed, from June 2021, medical tourism experienced a surge once again. The seventh year of Buhari’s administration — between June 2021 and May 2022 — recorded $6.96bn in health-related foreign exchange disbursements.June 2021 alone accounted for $3.02bn, almost matching the record set back in 2015. April 2022 saw another massive jump with $1.28bn spent, suggesting that Nigerians, particularly the affluent class and public officials, resumed international travel en masse to seek healthcare that remained inaccessible or underdeveloped at home.The eighth and final year of the administration recorded the second-highest annual expenditure, with $7.12bn spent between June 2022 and May 2023. January 2023 was a particularly costly month, accounting for $2.30bn in medical outflows — the third highest monthly figure during Buhari’s presidency.With this late surge in medical tourism spending, the second term of Buhari’s government, which initially appeared more conservative in terms of health-related foreign exchange usage, ended up outpacing the first term.Related NewsGenCos kick against Enugu’s Band A tariff cut to N160/kWhPresidential aide slams Kemi Badenoch over Nigerian citizenship claimBuhari never used vote-buying to win elections – OkechukwuA total of $16.56bn was spent in the second term, compared to $12.73bn in the first term. This shift suggests that, despite earlier constraints, the underlying drivers of medical tourism — including poor local healthcare infrastructure, lack of trust in domestic medical services, and the elite’s preference for foreign treatment — remained unaddressed and may have worsened.Throughout his presidency, Buhari was frequently criticised for seeking medical care abroad. He made multiple trips to the United Kingdom for undisclosed treatments, sometimes staying for extended periods.Buhari, during his eight-year reign, spent at least 225 days outside the country on medical trips, visiting no fewer than 40 countries since 2015. Eight months after assuming office, the former President embarked on his first medical trip to London, United Kingdom, on February 5, 2016, spending six days.His second medical trip followed four months later, on June 6, 2016, during which he spent 10 days treating an undisclosed ear infection. On January 19, 2017, Buhari embarked on his second-longest medical trip to London, spending 50 days away.In May of the same year, barely two months after his last trip, he returned to London for what became his longest medical stay, lasting 104 days. He did not return to the UK for medical purposes again until May 2018, when he spent four days on a follow-up review.In March 2021, Buhari departed for London once again, on what the Presidency described as a “routine medical check-up,” which lasted 15 days. His departure came amid a labour crisis in the health sector, during which members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors commenced an indefinite strike over unpaid allowances.Almost a year later, on March 6, 2022, the ex-President travelled to London again for medical reasons. This time, he spent 12 days. On October 31, 2022, Buhari departed from Owerri, the capital of Imo State, to London for another medical check-up, which lasted approximately two weeks. He returned to the country on November 13, 2022.Former presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, consistently defended Buhari’s foreign medical trips, stating that he “has used the same medical team for about 40 years.” In a recent interview following Buhari’s death, Adesina argued: “If he had said I’d do my medicals in Nigeria just for show off or something, he could have long been dead.”In total, Buhari undertook 84 trips to 40 countries during his tenure in office.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Medical and Dental Consultants’ Association of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors earlier criticised political leaders for consistently seeking medical care abroad while neglecting the country’s healthcare system.The President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, Dr Tope Osundara, described the trend as not only disheartening but an indictment of Nigerian leaders’ investments in the sector they are expected to strengthen.Osundara expressed disappointment that Nigerian leaders continue to patronise foreign hospitals despite annual budget allocations to domestic medical facilities like the State House Clinic.“It’s more like building a company, investing resources in it, then refusing to use the product and telling others to trust it. It tells you that something is fundamentally wrong with the system, with the people entrusted with managing it.“There was a time when the former president, Muhammad Buhari, made some utterances that they should abolish this medical tourism. But unfortunately, before he died, he was even at the forefront of going abroad for treatment. Even a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, disclosed that he and Buhari were admitted to the same hospital in London shortly before Buhari passed away. This tells you that Nigeria’s healthcare system is in bad shape.”On his part, the President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof Bala Audu, noted that while individuals are free to seek care wherever they choose, the consistent reliance of public office holders on foreign hospitals despite Nigeria’s budgetary allocations to domestic healthcare speaks volumes about misplaced priorities.","Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari , translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the re",
2025-07-21T11:39:35.377604,"Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash
Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo, has defended his remarks on Labour Party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Peter Obi, amid mounting backlash from human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), the African Democratic Congress and the Obidient Movement.The governor had stirred controversy after warning that Obi must obtain security clearance before visiting Edo State, a statement critics described as a direct threat to Obi’s life and a dangerous precedent for democracy.While Falana urged Obi to take legal action over what he termed an “illegal threat,” ADC and Obidient Movement leader, Dr Yunusa Tanko, accused Okpebholo of intimidation and spreading falsehoods.The Edo State government, however, insisted that the governor’s comments at a rally on Friday were misinterpreted, stressing that his call was a security protocol and not hostility toward the opposition leader.The governor slammed the critics, adding that the statement should not be misconstrued as a threat.In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Fred Itua, the government said that Okpebholo’s statement was given various misinterpretations.“The attention of the Edo State Government has been drawn to various misinterpretations surrounding the recent remarks made by Governor of Edo State, Senator Monday Okpebholo, regarding the visit of Peter Obi to the state.“It is imperative to state clearly that the governor did not issue any form of threat to Mr Obi, but rather emphasised the need for high-profile individuals, particularly politically exposed persons, to notify and seek security clearance from the governor before embarking on any public engagements within the state.“As the Chief Security Officer of Edo State, it is the governor’s constitutional responsibility to safeguard the lives and property of all residents and visitors alike.“This duty includes ensuring that adequate security measures are put in place during high-profile visits or events that may attract large crowds or media attention.“When such protocols are ignored, it creates serious security vulnerabilities, not only for the visitor but also for citizens who may be caught in avoidable threats,” the statement read.Itua said the governor’s position was relevant in light of the rising attacks and abductions of religious leaders, especially Catholic priests and Christian clerics.He noted that the state had witnessed its share of tragic incidents, including the abduction of seminarians and the killing of clergy in recent years.He noted that public donations made to churches, hospitals, or other faith-based institutions, while noble in intent, must be approached with caution and in full consultation with the appropriate security channels to avoid exposing these institutions and their leaders to further danger.He added, “The governor’s comments on the need for discretion in public giving are rooted in both security intelligence and moral responsibility…“Governor Okpebholo is not Peter Obi, who, as Governor of Anambra State, detained Nasir El-Rufai when he visited.“Furthermore, the governor’s concerns should not be twisted for political mileage by individuals seeking to score cheap points.“The state government will not fold its arms and allow politically motivated activities to endanger lives.“We expect leaders, no matter how highly placed, to align with the protocols and security realities of the areas they visit.”Earlier on Sunday, Falana had asked Okpebholo to withdraw the threats to the life of Obi.In a statement, the senior lawyer noted that the threat to the life of Obi issued by the “new sheriff in town” in Edo State constituted a violation of Section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples (Ratification and Enforcement), which guarantee the fundamental right of every citizen to life.“However, if Governor Okpebholo does not withdraw the illegal threat because of sheer arrogance of raw power, Mr Peter Obi should proceed to file an application in the Benin Judicial Division of the Federal High Court to secure the enforcement of his fundamental right to life.“Mr Obi should act with utmost urgency in view of the prevalence of mob justice and other forms of extrajudicial killings in the country,” the statement added.Related NewsADC: The new bride with two husbandsThose pushing for VP slot for Obi only want to ruin him – LP chieftainTaraba gov reaffirms PDP loyalty, dismisses ADC defection rumourThe ADC’s interim National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, speaking with journalists, warned that such threats were becoming a troubling trend among APC governors.He stressed that the party was informing both Nigerians and the international community about the situation, against the right to move freely across all states by every Nigerian.“The African Democratic Congress condemns the restriction order issued on Peter Obi.“This is not the first time. It is becoming a pattern for APC governors to make the kind of pronouncements credited to Governor Okpebholo, declaring that Mr Obi or opposition leaders are not welcome in their state.“This is not democratic, and it’s a very dangerous pattern. Nigeria is a free country, and every citizen of Nigeria has the right to go anywhere in this country.“We don’t need a visa in our country. We don’t need anybody’s permission to go to any part of our country.“This also speaks to an authoritarian instinct among some of these governors of the APC, and we believe that this can only get worse if it’s not nipped in the bud,” he added.Abdullahi said, having failed to turn Nigeria into a one-party state, the strategy is to begin to intimidate and issue threats and warnings not to come to their states.“This is unacceptable. We will go anywhere in Nigeria that we want because Nigeria is a free country,” he said.Tanko, in his reaction, debunked claims by Okpebholo that Obi was responsible for the 2013 detention of former Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai.Tanko, who also served as the campaign spokesman for Obi during the 2023 presidential election, described the allegation as “a complete falsehood.”Speaking in a phone interview with our correspondent, Tanko insisted that Okpebholo was either misinformed or deliberately peddling lies.“It is obvious Governor Okpebholo festers on lies and doesn’t even know what he is talking about.“Even Nasir can never come out to say that again after I debunked it. I have proof that there is no iota of truth in that allegation,” he said.He explained that at the time of the incident, he was the national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council and was physically present in Anambra State during the election where the controversy occurred.“I was the then-national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council during that election. Peter Obi was also then an APGA governor in Anambra, and the PDP was at the centre.“At that time, El-Rufai was the assistant secretary of the ACN. He has the fundamental right to go into the state and support his agent. But they thought he came with blood money to mobilise people and induce voters, so they denied him.“So it was the PDP, not Obi. Obi himself said it on the floor that he was seeking succour too for himself, not to block anybody,” he said.Tanko said he still possessed photographic evidence to support his claims and reminded the public that El-Rufai himself had brought the complaint directly to him during the election.“In fact, I can show you pictures of where I was seated as IPAC chairman when Nasir himself brought the complaint to me.“I still have them, and I remember also hosting a press conference on this particular issue at the campaign venue of Peter Obi,” he said.Tanko also dismissed Okpebholo’s political experience, calling him a “greenhorn.”“It is obvious Okpebholo is just a greenhorn in this game of politics. The governor doesn’t know anything. He is just shooting blanks.”","Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash.

2025-07-21T11:44:36.859563,"Race to 2027: PDP’s flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit
•Zoning, consensus strategy top Thursday’s PDP’s NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party’s 2027 presidential ticket underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has cleared the way for Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, and other hopefuls seeking to challenge President Bola Tinubu, The PUNCH reports.Reliable PDP insiders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the presidential ambitions of Makinde and Bala were well known among key party stakeholders.Another party source revealed that the PDP remained open to any aspirant willing to contest for the presidential ticket in line with the party’s constitution.While PDP chieftain Chief Bode George confirmed in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH that efforts to secure a southern presidential flagbearer are underway, other National Executive Committee members have expressed differing opinions on the issue of zoning.As the PDP prepares for its 101st NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday July 24, The PUNCH exclusively gathered that critical issues — such as zoning and the party’s national convention — are high on the agenda for discussion and resolution.Reacting in an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the All Progressives Congress Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, stated that no matter the PDP’s zoning decision or choice of candidate, the party was destined for defeat in 2027.Recently, during its 100th NEC meeting held on June 30, the PDP resolved the long-standing dispute over the position of National Secretary by confirming Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the party’s scribe.However, despite this resolution, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and some of his loyalists left the party, citing unresolved internal conflicts. Atiku, along with other opposition figures, has continued to criticise the ruling APC for its poor governance performance.In response, on July 1, Atiku, 2023 Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi; former APC presidential aspirant, Rotimi Amaechi; former Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai, and others united under the African Democratic Congress, positioning it as a joint opposition platform to challenge the APC in the 2027 elections.As part of this coalition effort, they appointed former Senate President David Mark as interim National Chairman and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola as interim National Secretary.Explaining his departure from the PDP, Atiku, who was the party’s presidential flagbearer in 2019 and 2023, said the party’s current trajectory no longer reflected its founding values, prompting his decision to step away.Atiku’s letter read in part, “I am writing to formally resign my membership from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) with immediate effect.“I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude for the opportunities I have been given by the Party. Serving two full terms as Vice President of Nigeria and being a Presidential candidate twice has been one of the most significant chapters of my life. As a founding father of this esteemed Party, it is indeed heartbreaking for me to make this decision.“However, I find it necessary to part ways due to the current trajectory the Party has taken, which I believe diverges from the foundational principles we stood for. It is with a heavy heart that I resign, recognizing the irreconcilable differences that have emerged.”A party insider told The PUNCH that Atiku’s 2027 presidential ambition has posed a challenge both to the party’s stability and to the aspirations of other contenders.The source stated, “You see, the exit of Atiku Abubakar is going to bring calm to the party. You know, before now, his ambition has always been a threat to the ambition of others, even to the peace in the party.“Party leaders are always skeptical about how they resolve one or two issues so that they won’t play into his hands or into his favour. But now that he has left the party, I think it’s going to clear the path for others to pursue their ambition.“I know that the likes of Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and other leaders of our party are aspiring to run on the party’s ticket for the 2027 election. But of course, popular among leaders of the party and other stakeholders within the party for now are Makinde and Bala Mohammed.“We know that others will still come and aspire for the party’s ticket come 2027. As a matter of fact, the doors of the party are open to those who are willing to aspire for the ticket.“PDP is a party for all Nigerians. It is a popular party with structure across all the local governments, the wards, and the states, a very formidable opposition. Forget the noise that the ADC is making. PDP still remains the major opposition party. We have governors. We have senators. We have elected assembly members and quite a lot more to offer Nigerians.”Another source stated that Atiku’s presidential ambition has consistently caused turmoil within the PDP, adding that his departure would create room for fresh and capable individuals to pursue their aspirations.He stated, “I listened to many Nigerians talking about Atiku’s exit. They focus on just looking at the whole PDP as finished, the whole PDP as that. But the other positive side to it: would Atiku’s ambition, or has Atiku’s ambition been a source of problem for the PDP in the last, let’s say, eight years?“Of course, the ambition had caused crisis for in party. Recall in 2019, it was a tug-of-war within the party. And in 2023, you know, the five governors and quite a lot of others still did not support Atiku’s ambition and presidential ambition. Even though he emerged as a candidate, most of them still did not work for him. In fact, that was when Peter Obi also left the party.“So, a man who, to a large extent, his ambition has always caused disaffection within the party, then decides to leave the party. So, it’s also a thing of joy for some of us that are members of the party now that he has left to pursue his ambition elsewhere. Then the party can sit up, sit together and resolve some of their issues. And then this will allow a new crop of leaders to emerge, new set of credible and competent leaders that we have in our party to declare their own interests and aspire for the party’s ticket.”Our source named Makinde and Bala Mohammed as potential aspirants, saying more Nigerians will follow.He source stated, “Well, you are asking me who and who are interested in the party ticket so far. Well, even though they have not come out publicly to declare their interest, we have been hearing among us, the leaders of the party, that the likes of Makinde and then Bala Mohammed and even some former governors from the South are interested in aspiring for the party’s ticket for the 2027 presidential election.“But it is, of course, too early, because we know with time more people will declare, and then more will still join the party and aspire for the party ticket. So the PDP is open to all, and it is the party that is very popular among Nigerians.”Attempts by our correspondent to reach PDP Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, were unsuccessful as he did not answer calls.Attempts to reach Governor Bala’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mukhtar Gidado, through calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages were unsuccessful.Meanwhile, The PUNCH noticed that a youth group known as the Bala Mohammed Vanguard has been actively mobilising support for Governor Bala’s presidential ambition.The group, led by its Director-General Mohammed Jibo — who also serves as Chairman of Dass Local Government Area and a close political associate of the governor — has been at the forefront of the campaign.Speaking on the matter, the group’s Director of Media and Publicity, Mudaddasir Musa, confirmed that Governor Bala would throw his hat in the ring in the 2027 general election.Related NewsADC: The new bride with two husbandsThose pushing for VP slot for Obi only want to ruin him – LP chieftainReform-induced agony persistsHe stated, “Governor Bala Mohammed will aspire for the Presidency. And we are strongly behind him, following his track records as public servant, FCT minister.“Till this time, no one has matched his steps as FCT minister, likewise in Bauchi, there has never been a governor that built capital projects like him. Bala Mohammed is the only individual we believe can save Nigeria from its present security and economic crisis.”While a credible NEC source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the issue, supported throwing open the 2027 PDP’s presidential ticket to all Nigerians, others like George and Deputy National Youth Leader Timothy Osadolor are pushing for a southern candidate.However, former PDP National Vice Chairman (South West), Eddy Olafeso, stated that party leaders were committed to learning from past mistakes, while former National Secretary, Ibrahim Tsauri, advised members to allow the party’s organs to make decisions and cautioned against preempting the NEC and zoning committee’s outcomes.The source argued that opening the contest would allow credible, popular, and competent candidates to emerge.He stated, “Zoning is not a constitutional matter. There is no section of our constitution that says the Presidency must be zoned to any geopolitical zone. So I think, for me, considering how the party has been managed for a while and the last couple of elections, the party should throw its ticket open for 2027.“This will give room to credible people. We’ll have more people who are competent coming to aspire for the ticket. And consequently, competent and capable candidates will emerge that will likely give us the victory that we’ve been yearning for.“The ticket should be open to all Nigerians. This is not the time to say it’s South or North, no. Let’s leave it open. Let the most popular win. Let the most competent emerge.”This is just as the former Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, George, hinted that the search for such a person has begun.George told The PUNCH, “That process of getting a southerner as presidential flagbearer of the party is on. In politics, there is no shut down. We are going for a meeting this week, a make or break meeting if you like.“Arrangements are going on already and there are quite some respectable, responsible people with good character, tested and proven but it is too early to start throwing names up. If you do that now, you are looking for trouble,” he said.In an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, Osadolor warned against narrowing the 2027 presidential race to Atiku, Obi, and President Tinubu.He called for the PDP’s 2027 presidential ticket to be zoned to the South.Osadolor stated, “Well, the truth is this. Limiting a country of over 240 million people to just names on a list of less than 10, which the Waziri of Adamawa (Atiku) happens to be one of, I think it’s a disservice to over 240 million Nigerians and over 10 million Nigerians that are eligible to be President of this nation.“You see, there is nobody that was created or given birth to, and the staff of office of President was presented to or handed over to from the Israelis. Many Nigerians that are constitutionally qualified have rights to contest.“The truth is this: narrowing down the PDP ticket or any ticket to only Atiku, Obi or Tinubu is a disservice to the rest of all Nigerians. I believe that there are other people in the country and within the PDP who also have track records of service delivery to Nigerian people.”However, Osadolor suggested that the PDP is still waiting for former President Goodluck Jonathan to make a decision on whether he will contest or not.He stated, “We have people like Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom, who transformed the landscape of Akwa Ibom into something else. We have the governor of Oyo, Seyi Makinde, who is doing incredibly well and has turned the landscape of Oyo from an ancient sleeping kingdom into a modern, fast-growing industrial state.“So, there are people. There are people everywhere. So, as the days go by — and you are also aware — Goodluck Jonathan is there too. So, there are other people like him within the party, it’s a matter of decision-making for them to convince themselves that they want to throw their hat in the ring.“Therefore, I can assure you, PDP is not going to run out of options. Not today, not anytime soon. And I also know that the PDP ticket is going to the South.“The indices are there. The party — the last time, I it was thrown open. And I think the voices is audible enough and it is clearer to most of us, that it is going to South this time around.”Olafeso remarked that just as the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not mark the end of Japan, the departure of Atiku and others will not spell the end of the PDP.The former PDP National Vice Chairman expressed confidence that the party will emerge stronger from the situation.He added, “Our desire at this moment is to stabilise our party and begin to ensure that the mistakes we made in the past will be a milestone through which we guide our actions in the future.”On the zoning of the PDP 2027 presidential ticket, Olafeso said, “We’re all committed to the fact that we have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that we stick to the constitution of our party, and that everything we do must be driven by fairness, equity, and justice.”Speaking exclusively with one of our correspondents, Tsauri stated that the PDP was already widely accepted by Nigerians and will make anyone who emerges as its 2027 presidential candidate popular.He stated, “Our party is popular. PDP is still the most popular party in Nigeria. Any individual who emerges as the party’s candidate, the party will make the person popular, because it is the most popular party in Nigeria today.“For the zoning of the 2027 presidential ticket, I will appeal that we all wait for the NEC and the zoning committee to decide. We should not preempt the organs of the party.”Meanwhile, a credible high-ranking PDP member, who spoke to The PUNCH on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorisation, revealed that the 101st NEC meeting would discuss whether the convention will still hold as scheduled in August.He stated, “As you are aware, the 101st NEC meeting is slated for Thursday, July 24. Plans are underway for the meeting to hold as scheduled.“And the major issue to be discussed is the National Elective Convention. The NEC will take reports from the committees, including the zoning committee. It will review how feasible it is to hold the convention in August as scheduled. So, zoning and the convention will be deliberated.”In response, the APC Director of Publicity Bala Ibrahim said President Tinubu would defeat Makinde, Bala Mohammed, or any other candidate the PDP presents in the election.Ibrahim stated, “These are people (Makinde and Bala Mohammed) that are not of any relevance at the national level. These are regional players that cannot stand the test of national politics. They don’t have the competitive advantage over our own candidate.“So the people you mentioned — they are not people that can beat him under any level playing field. It’s not an issue that will give us any bitter pain. Regardless of which zone the PDP goes to or the candidate they settle for, defeat awaits them all.”","Race to 2027: PDP’s flagbearer battle begins after Atiku’s exit. •Zoning, consensus strategy top Thursday’s PDP NEC agenda•Makinde, Bala eye ticketWith the race for the Peoples Democratic Party presidential ticket of 2027 underway, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s exit has ",
2025-07-21T11:44:44.232077,"Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari
Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, The PUNCH reports. This translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the review period.This is according to a detailed analysis of data from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s quarterly statistical bulletins. The sum, recorded under the “Health-Related and Social Services” category, reflects cumulative outflows of foreign exchange from June 2015 to May 2023 — precisely covering the duration of Buhari’s two-term presidency, which spanned from May 29, 2015, to May 28, 2023.The data, reviewed by our correspondent, shows the depth of Nigeria’s dependence on foreign healthcare services, with the CBN’s record showing a year-on-year movement of funds abroad for medical purposes amid economic downturns or dollar shortages at home.It also highlights the irony that, despite repeated declarations by the administration to revamp the health sector and reduce capital flight, health-related foreign exchange outflows remained significant and even spiked dramatically during the latter years of Buhari’s presidency.A close review of the spending pattern shows that the first year of Buhari’s presidency recorded the single highest amount spent on medical tourism. Between June 2015 and May 2016, Nigeria spent $7.81bn on health-related services abroad.This figure alone accounted for over a quarter of the total medical tourism expenditure under his administration. Notably, September 2015 stood out as a month of exceptional outflow, with $3.20bn disbursed — the highest for any single month throughout the eight-year period.That spike occurred during Buhari’s first few months in office and was followed by elevated monthly figures in October, November, and December of 2015, which further raised questions about whether the expenditure reflected a backlog of deferred medical bills or a broader trend among elites seeking healthcare abroad immediately after the administration took office.In the subsequent year, between June 2016 and May 2017, the figure dipped to $2.76bn, although substantial sums were still recorded in months such as March 2016 ($0.96bn) and April 2016 ($0.67bn).Spending continued to decline in Buhari’s third year in office, falling to $1.72bn between June 2017 and May 2018. By the fourth year of the first term, which ran from June 2018 to May 2019, Nigeria’s medical tourism bill had dropped sharply to just $0.44bn — the lowest across all eight years.However, a closer examination of the second term reveals a different picture. After a relatively low fifth year, when Nigeria spent $0.92bn on medical services abroad between June 2019 and May 2020, there was a slight increase in the sixth year, with foreign exchange outflows reaching $1.57bn.This modest recovery coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed global travel restrictions and temporarily subdued international medical travel. The data during the lockdown period between April 2020 and June 2021 reflected lower figures, but it also hinted at pent-up demand that would soon be unleashed.Indeed, from June 2021, medical tourism experienced a surge once again. The seventh year of Buhari’s administration — between June 2021 and May 2022 — recorded $6.96bn in health-related foreign exchange disbursements.June 2021 alone accounted for $3.02bn, almost matching the record set back in 2015. April 2022 saw another massive jump with $1.28bn spent, suggesting that Nigerians, particularly the affluent class and public officials, resumed international travel en masse to seek healthcare that remained inaccessible or underdeveloped at home.The eighth and final year of the administration recorded the second-highest annual expenditure, with $7.12bn spent between June 2022 and May 2023. January 2023 was a particularly costly month, accounting for $2.30bn in medical outflows — the third highest monthly figure during Buhari’s presidency.With this late surge in medical tourism spending, the second term of Buhari’s government, which initially appeared more conservative in terms of health-related foreign exchange usage, ended up outpacing the first term.Related NewsGenCos kick against Enugu’s Band A tariff cut to N160/kWhPresidential aide slams Kemi Badenoch over Nigerian citizenship claimBuhari never used vote-buying to win elections – OkechukwuA total of $16.56bn was spent in the second term, compared to $12.73bn in the first term. This shift suggests that, despite earlier constraints, the underlying drivers of medical tourism — including poor local healthcare infrastructure, lack of trust in domestic medical services, and the elite’s preference for foreign treatment — remained unaddressed and may have worsened.Throughout his presidency, Buhari was frequently criticised for seeking medical care abroad. He made multiple trips to the United Kingdom for undisclosed treatments, sometimes staying for extended periods.Buhari, during his eight-year reign, spent at least 225 days outside the country on medical trips, visiting no fewer than 40 countries since 2015. Eight months after assuming office, the former President embarked on his first medical trip to London, United Kingdom, on February 5, 2016, spending six days.His second medical trip followed four months later, on June 6, 2016, during which he spent 10 days treating an undisclosed ear infection. On January 19, 2017, Buhari embarked on his second-longest medical trip to London, spending 50 days away.In May of the same year, barely two months after his last trip, he returned to London for what became his longest medical stay, lasting 104 days. He did not return to the UK for medical purposes again until May 2018, when he spent four days on a follow-up review.In March 2021, Buhari departed for London once again, on what the Presidency described as a “routine medical check-up,” which lasted 15 days. His departure came amid a labour crisis in the health sector, during which members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors commenced an indefinite strike over unpaid allowances.Almost a year later, on March 6, 2022, the ex-President travelled to London again for medical reasons. This time, he spent 12 days. On October 31, 2022, Buhari departed from Owerri, the capital of Imo State, to London for another medical check-up, which lasted approximately two weeks. He returned to the country on November 13, 2022.Former presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, consistently defended Buhari’s foreign medical trips, stating that he “has used the same medical team for about 40 years.” In a recent interview following Buhari’s death, Adesina argued: “If he had said I’d do my medicals in Nigeria just for show off or something, he could have long been dead.”In total, Buhari undertook 84 trips to 40 countries during his tenure in office.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Medical and Dental Consultants’ Association of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors earlier criticised political leaders for consistently seeking medical care abroad while neglecting the country’s healthcare system.The President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, Dr Tope Osundara, described the trend as not only disheartening but an indictment of Nigerian leaders’ investments in the sector they are expected to strengthen.Osundara expressed disappointment that Nigerian leaders continue to patronise foreign hospitals despite annual budget allocations to domestic medical facilities like the State House Clinic.“It’s more like building a company, investing resources in it, then refusing to use the product and telling others to trust it. It tells you that something is fundamentally wrong with the system, with the people entrusted with managing it.“There was a time when the former president, Muhammad Buhari, made some utterances that they should abolish this medical tourism. But unfortunately, before he died, he was even at the forefront of going abroad for treatment. Even a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, disclosed that he and Buhari were admitted to the same hospital in London shortly before Buhari passed away. This tells you that Nigeria’s healthcare system is in bad shape.”On his part, the President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof Bala Audu, noted that while individuals are free to seek care wherever they choose, the consistent reliance of public office holders on foreign hospitals despite Nigeria’s budgetary allocations to domestic healthcare speaks volumes about misplaced priorities.","Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari , translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the re",

2025-07-21T16:50:36.451392,"Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash
Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo, has defended his remarks on Labour Party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Peter Obi, amid mounting backlash from human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), the African Democratic Congress and the Obidient Movement.The governor had stirred controversy after warning that Obi must obtain security clearance before visiting Edo State, a statement critics described as a direct threat to Obi’s life and a dangerous precedent for democracy.While Falana urged Obi to take legal action over what he termed an “illegal threat,” ADC and Obidient Movement leader, Dr Yunusa Tanko, accused Okpebholo of intimidation and spreading falsehoods.The Edo State government, however, insisted that the governor’s comments at a rally on Friday were misinterpreted, stressing that his call was a security protocol and not hostility toward the opposition leader.The governor slammed the critics, adding that the statement should not be misconstrued as a threat.In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Fred Itua, the government said that Okpebholo’s statement was given various misinterpretations.“The attention of the Edo State Government has been drawn to various misinterpretations surrounding the recent remarks made by Governor of Edo State, Senator Monday Okpebholo, regarding the visit of Peter Obi to the state.“It is imperative to state clearly that the governor did not issue any form of threat to Mr Obi, but rather emphasised the need for high-profile individuals, particularly politically exposed persons, to notify and seek security clearance from the governor before embarking on any public engagements within the state.“As the Chief Security Officer of Edo State, it is the governor’s constitutional responsibility to safeguard the lives and property of all residents and visitors alike.“This duty includes ensuring that adequate security measures are put in place during high-profile visits or events that may attract large crowds or media attention.“When such protocols are ignored, it creates serious security vulnerabilities, not only for the visitor but also for citizens who may be caught in avoidable threats,” the statement read.Itua said the governor’s position was relevant in light of the rising attacks and abductions of religious leaders, especially Catholic priests and Christian clerics.He noted that the state had witnessed its share of tragic incidents, including the abduction of seminarians and the killing of clergy in recent years.He noted that public donations made to churches, hospitals, or other faith-based institutions, while noble in intent, must be approached with caution and in full consultation with the appropriate security channels to avoid exposing these institutions and their leaders to further danger.He added, “The governor’s comments on the need for discretion in public giving are rooted in both security intelligence and moral responsibility…“Governor Okpebholo is not Peter Obi, who, as Governor of Anambra State, detained Nasir El-Rufai when he visited.“Furthermore, the governor’s concerns should not be twisted for political mileage by individuals seeking to score cheap points.“The state government will not fold its arms and allow politically motivated activities to endanger lives.“We expect leaders, no matter how highly placed, to align with the protocols and security realities of the areas they visit.”Earlier on Sunday, Falana had asked Okpebholo to withdraw the threats to the life of Obi.In a statement, the senior lawyer noted that the threat to the life of Obi issued by the “new sheriff in town” in Edo State constituted a violation of Section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples (Ratification and Enforcement), which guarantee the fundamental right of every citizen to life.“However, if Governor Okpebholo does not withdraw the illegal threat because of sheer arrogance of raw power, Mr Peter Obi should proceed to file an application in the Benin Judicial Division of the Federal High Court to secure the enforcement of his fundamental right to life.“Mr Obi should act with utmost urgency in view of the prevalence of mob justice and other forms of extrajudicial killings in the country,” the statement added.Related NewsYour children are Nigerians, Falana corrects Badenoch on citizenship claimKebbi govt replies critics, defends Idris' performanceADC was packaged for Atiku’s 2027 ambition - KachikwuThe ADC’s interim National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, speaking with journalists, warned that such threats were becoming a troubling trend among APC governors.He stressed that the party was informing both Nigerians and the international community about the situation, against the right to move freely across all states by every Nigerian.“The African Democratic Congress condemns the restriction order issued on Peter Obi.“This is not the first time. It is becoming a pattern for APC governors to make the kind of pronouncements credited to Governor Okpebholo, declaring that Mr Obi or opposition leaders are not welcome in their state.“This is not democratic, and it’s a very dangerous pattern. Nigeria is a free country, and every citizen of Nigeria has the right to go anywhere in this country.“We don’t need a visa in our country. We don’t need anybody’s permission to go to any part of our country.“This also speaks to an authoritarian instinct among some of these governors of the APC, and we believe that this can only get worse if it’s not nipped in the bud,” he added.Abdullahi said, having failed to turn Nigeria into a one-party state, the strategy is to begin to intimidate and issue threats and warnings not to come to their states.“This is unacceptable. We will go anywhere in Nigeria that we want because Nigeria is a free country,” he said.Tanko, in his reaction, debunked claims by Okpebholo that Obi was responsible for the 2013 detention of former Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai.Tanko, who also served as the campaign spokesman for Obi during the 2023 presidential election, described the allegation as “a complete falsehood.”Speaking in a phone interview with our correspondent, Tanko insisted that Okpebholo was either misinformed or deliberately peddling lies.“It is obvious Governor Okpebholo festers on lies and doesn’t even know what he is talking about.“Even Nasir can never come out to say that again after I debunked it. I have proof that there is no iota of truth in that allegation,” he said.He explained that at the time of the incident, he was the national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council and was physically present in Anambra State during the election where the controversy occurred.“I was the then-national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council during that election. Peter Obi was also then an APGA governor in Anambra, and the PDP was at the centre.“At that time, El-Rufai was the assistant secretary of the ACN.

2025-07-21T16:51:47.150888,"Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari
Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, The PUNCH reports. This translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during the review period.This is according to a detailed analysis of data from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s quarterly statistical bulletins. The sum, recorded under the “Health-Related and Social Services” category, reflects cumulative outflows of foreign exchange from June 2015 to May 2023 — precisely covering the duration of Buhari’s two-term presidency, which spanned from May 29, 2015, to May 28, 2023.The data, reviewed by our correspondent, shows the depth of Nigeria’s dependence on foreign healthcare services, with the CBN’s record showing a year-on-year movement of funds abroad for medical purposes amid economic downturns or dollar shortages at home.It also highlights the irony that, despite repeated declarations by the administration to revamp the health sector and reduce capital flight, health-related foreign exchange outflows remained significant and even spiked dramatically during the latter years of Buhari’s presidency.A close review of the spending pattern shows that the first year of Buhari’s presidency recorded the single highest amount spent on medical tourism. Between June 2015 and May 2016, Nigeria spent $7.81bn on health-related services abroad.This figure alone accounted for over a quarter of the total medical tourism expenditure under his administration. Notably, September 2015 stood out as a month of exceptional outflow, with $3.20bn disbursed — the highest for any single month throughout the eight-year period.That spike occurred during Buhari’s first few months in office and was followed by elevated monthly figures in October, November, and December of 2015, which further raised questions about whether the expenditure reflected a backlog of deferred medical bills or a broader trend among elites seeking healthcare abroad immediately after the administration took office.In the subsequent year, between June 2016 and May 2017, the figure dipped to $2.76bn, although substantial sums were still recorded in months such as March 2016 ($0.96bn) and April 2016 ($0.67bn).Spending continued to decline in Buhari’s third year in office, falling to $1.72bn between June 2017 and May 2018. By the fourth year of the first term, which ran from June 2018 to May 2019, Nigeria’s medical tourism bill had dropped sharply to just $0.44bn — the lowest across all eight years.However, a closer examination of the second term reveals a different picture. After a relatively low fifth year, when Nigeria spent $0.92bn on medical services abroad between June 2019 and May 2020, there was a slight increase in the sixth year, with foreign exchange outflows reaching $1.57bn.This modest recovery coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed global travel restrictions and temporarily subdued international medical travel. The data during the lockdown period between April 2020 and June 2021 reflected lower figures, but it also hinted at pent-up demand that would soon be unleashed.Indeed, from June 2021, medical tourism experienced a surge once again. The seventh year of Buhari’s administration — between June 2021 and May 2022 — recorded $6.96bn in health-related foreign exchange disbursements.June 2021 alone accounted for $3.02bn, almost matching the record set back in 2015. April 2022 saw another massive jump with $1.28bn spent, suggesting that Nigerians, particularly the affluent class and public officials, resumed international travel en masse to seek healthcare that remained inaccessible or underdeveloped at home.The eighth and final year of the administration recorded the second-highest annual expenditure, with $7.12bn spent between June 2022 and May 2023. January 2023 was a particularly costly month, accounting for $2.30bn in medical outflows — the third highest monthly figure during Buhari’s presidency.With this late surge in medical tourism spending, the second term of Buhari’s government, which initially appeared more conservative in terms of health-related foreign exchange usage, ended up outpacing the first term.Related NewsICRC warns of rising malnutrition as North-East faces food shortagesHisbah destroys N5.8m worth of alcohol in JigawaNiDCOM unveils housing initiative for Nigerians abroadA total of $16.56bn was spent in the second term, compared to $12.73bn in the first term. This shift suggests that, despite earlier constraints, the underlying drivers of medical tourism — including poor local healthcare infrastructure, lack of trust in domestic medical services, and the elite’s preference for foreign treatment — remained unaddressed and may have worsened.Throughout his presidency, Buhari was frequently criticised for seeking medical care abroad. He made multiple trips to the United Kingdom for undisclosed treatments, sometimes staying for extended periods.Buhari, during his eight-year reign, spent at least 225 days outside the country on medical trips, visiting no fewer than 40 countries since 2015. Eight months after assuming office, the former President embarked on his first medical trip to London, United Kingdom, on February 5, 2016, spending six days.His second medical trip followed four months later, on June 6, 2016, during which he spent 10 days treating an undisclosed ear infection. On January 19, 2017, Buhari embarked on his second-longest medical trip to London, spending 50 days away.In May of the same year, barely two months after his last trip, he returned to London for what became his longest medical stay, lasting 104 days. He did not return to the UK for medical purposes again until May 2018, when he spent four days on a follow-up review.In March 2021, Buhari departed for London once again, on what the Presidency described as a “routine medical check-up,” which lasted 15 days. His departure came amid a labour crisis in the health sector, during which members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors commenced an indefinite strike over unpaid allowances.Almost a year later, on March 6, 2022, the ex-President travelled to London again for medical reasons. This time, he spent 12 days. On October 31, 2022, Buhari departed from Owerri, the capital of Imo State, to London for another medical check-up, which lasted approximately two weeks. He returned to the country on November 13, 2022.Former presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, consistently defended Buhari’s foreign medical trips, stating that he “has used the same medical team for about 40 years.” In a recent interview following Buhari’s death, Adesina argued: “If he had said I’d do my medicals in Nigeria just for show off or something, he could have long been dead.”In total, Buhari undertook 84 trips to 40 countries during his tenure in office.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Medical and Dental Consultants’ Association of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors earlier criticised political leaders for consistently seeking medical care abroad while neglecting the country’s healthcare system.The President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, Dr Tope Osundara, described the trend as not only disheartening but an indictment of Nigerian leaders’ investments in the sector they are expected to strengthen.Osundara expressed disappointment that Nigerian leaders continue to patronise foreign hospitals despite annual budget allocations to domestic medical facilities like the State House Clinic.“It’s more like building a company, investing resources in it, then refusing to use the product and telling others to trust it. It tells you that something is fundamentally wrong with the system, with the people entrusted with managing it.“There was a time when the former president, Muhammad Buhari, made some utterances that they should abolish this medical tourism. But unfortunately, before he died, he was even at the forefront of going abroad for treatment. Even a former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, disclosed that he and Buhari were admitted to the same hospital in London shortly before Buhari passed away. This tells you that Nigeria’s healthcare system is in bad shape.”On his part, the President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof Bala Audu, noted that while individuals are free to seek care wherever they choose, the consistent reliance of public office holders on foreign hospitals despite Nigeria’s budgetary allocations to domestic healthcare speaks volumes about misplaced priorities.","Nigerians spent over $3.6bn annually on foreign healthcare under Buhari Nigerians spent at least $29.29bn on foreign medical expenses during the eight years of the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari , which translates to an annual spending of about $3.6bn during ",https://twitter.com/user/status/1947309684118925602
2025-07-21T16:52:02.573008,"Okpebholo slams Obi as Edo movement ban ignites backlash
Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo, has defended his remarks on Labour Party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Peter Obi, amid mounting backlash from human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), the African Democratic Congress and the Obidient Movement.The governor had stirred controversy after warning that Obi must obtain security clearance before visiting Edo State, a statement critics described as a direct threat to Obi’s life and a dangerous precedent for democracy.While Falana urged Obi to take legal action over what he termed an “illegal threat,” ADC and Obidient Movement leader, Dr Yunusa Tanko, accused Okpebholo of intimidation and spreading falsehoods.The Edo State government, however, insisted that the governor’s comments at a rally on Friday were misinterpreted, stressing that his call was a security protocol and not hostility toward the opposition leader.The governor slammed the critics, adding that the statement should not be misconstrued as a threat.In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Fred Itua, the government said that Okpebholo’s statement was given various misinterpretations.“The attention of the Edo State Government has been drawn to various misinterpretations surrounding the recent remarks made by Governor of Edo State, Senator Monday Okpebholo, regarding the visit of Peter Obi to the state.“It is imperative to state clearly that the governor did not issue any form of threat to Mr Obi, but rather emphasised the need for high-profile individuals, particularly politically exposed persons, to notify and seek security clearance from the governor before embarking on any public engagements within the state.“As the Chief Security Officer of Edo State, it is the governor’s constitutional responsibility to safeguard the lives and property of all residents and visitors alike.“This duty includes ensuring that adequate security measures are put in place during high-profile visits or events that may attract large crowds or media attention.“When such protocols are ignored, it creates serious security vulnerabilities, not only for the visitor but also for citizens who may be caught in avoidable threats,” the statement read.Itua said the governor’s position was relevant in light of the rising attacks and abductions of religious leaders, especially Catholic priests and Christian clerics.He noted that the state had witnessed its share of tragic incidents, including the abduction of seminarians and the killing of clergy in recent years.He noted that public donations made to churches, hospitals, or other faith-based institutions, while noble in intent, must be approached with caution and in full consultation with the appropriate security channels to avoid exposing these institutions and their leaders to further danger.He added, “The governor’s comments on the need for discretion in public giving are rooted in both security intelligence and moral responsibility…“Governor Okpebholo is not Peter Obi, who, as Governor of Anambra State, detained Nasir El-Rufai when he visited.“Furthermore, the governor’s concerns should not be twisted for political mileage by individuals seeking to score cheap points.“The state government will not fold its arms and allow politically motivated activities to endanger lives.“We expect leaders, no matter how highly placed, to align with the protocols and security realities of the areas they visit.”Earlier on Sunday, Falana had asked Okpebholo to withdraw the threats to the life of Obi.In a statement, the senior lawyer noted that the threat to the life of Obi issued by the “new sheriff in town” in Edo State constituted a violation of Section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples (Ratification and Enforcement), which guarantee the fundamental right of every citizen to life.“However, if Governor Okpebholo does not withdraw the illegal threat because of sheer arrogance of raw power, Mr Peter Obi should proceed to file an application in the Benin Judicial Division of the Federal High Court to secure the enforcement of his fundamental right to life.“Mr Obi should act with utmost urgency in view of the prevalence of mob justice and other forms of extrajudicial killings in the country,” the statement added.Related NewsYour children are Nigerians, Falana corrects Badenoch on citizenship claimKebbi govt replies critics, defends Idris' performanceADC was packaged for Atiku’s 2027 ambition - KachikwuThe ADC’s interim National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, speaking with journalists, warned that such threats were becoming a troubling trend among APC governors.He stressed that the party was informing both Nigerians and the international community about the situation, against the right to move freely across all states by every Nigerian.“The African Democratic Congress condemns the restriction order issued on Peter Obi.“This is not the first time. It is becoming a pattern for APC governors to make the kind of pronouncements credited to Governor Okpebholo, declaring that Mr Obi or opposition leaders are not welcome in their state.“This is not democratic, and it’s a very dangerous pattern. Nigeria is a free country, and every citizen of Nigeria has the right to go anywhere in this country.“We don’t need a visa in our country. We don’t need anybody’s permission to go to any part of our country.“This also speaks to an authoritarian instinct among some of these governors of the APC, and we believe that this can only get worse if it’s not nipped in the bud,” he added.Abdullahi said, having failed to turn Nigeria into a one-party state, the strategy is to begin to intimidate and issue threats and warnings not to come to their states.“This is unacceptable. We will go anywhere in Nigeria that we want because Nigeria is a free country,” he said.Tanko, in his reaction, debunked claims by Okpebholo that Obi was responsible for the 2013 detention of former Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai.Tanko, who also served as the campaign spokesman for Obi during the 2023 presidential election, described the allegation as “a complete falsehood.”Speaking in a phone interview with our correspondent, Tanko insisted that Okpebholo was either misinformed or deliberately peddling lies.“It is obvious Governor Okpebholo festers on lies and doesn’t even know what he is talking about.“Even Nasir can never come out to say that again after I debunked it. I have proof that there is no iota of truth in that allegation,” he said.He explained that at the time of the incident, he was the national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council and was physically present in Anambra State during the election where the controversy occurred.“I was the then-national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council during that election. Peter Obi was also then an APGA governor in Anambra, and the PDP was at the centre.“At that time, El-Rufai was the assistant secretary of the ACN. He has the fundamental right to go into the state and support his agent. But they thought he came with blood money to mobilise people and induce voters, so they denied him.“So it was the PDP, not Obi.
